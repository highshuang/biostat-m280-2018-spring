### Overall Grade: 100/100

### Quality of report: 10/10

* Is the homework submitted (git tag time) before deadline?

	Yes. `2018-04-26 21:35:26 -0700`.

* Is the final report in a human readable format html?  

	Yes. `html`.

* Is the report prepared as a dynamic document (Jupyter notebook) for better reproducibility?

	Yes. `ipynb`.

* Is the report clear (whole sentences, typos, grammar)? Do readers have a clear idea what's going on and how are results produced by just reading the report?

	The report has rich details of proof, it is well written. It would be better if you copy the questions first and answer them. Just so that years later you are able to read a self-contained report.
